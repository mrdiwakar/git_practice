1.Git is a software basically that let's you manage your online code based software projects by enabling multiple people to collaborate in a project and keeping track of all the changes made in the project and enabling you to go back in time and reverse your changes to a past version as well.

2. Github is a platform (online) that lets you host your git folders or projects with git functionality enabled in them. 

git coupled with github makes collaborating and keeping track of various projects easy for us.

basic git commands: 
1. git init: to initialize a repository.
2. git status: to check whether any changes has been made and been tracked or not.
3. git add <file_name> : to add the file to staging area (an area where all files must be kept in order to track any changes made in them)
4. git commit: to commit all the changes into the git repository and save those changs permanently for future reference so that we can come back and have them modified incase if we need them to be.


** you can not make changes in any other persons project therefore there is an option to fork. so you have to fork that code into your github account (simply put, you copy the ocde into your acccount.) and then you clone that code to your system using "git clone <link>" also since it is your profile from which you are clonning the code the name by default of the remote folder is origin **
